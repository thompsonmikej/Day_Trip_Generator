# Day Trip Generator

## Developed at devCodeCamp

A lightweight Python console app that helps users build a custom day trip itinerary. The app randomly suggests options from several categories, letting users approve or reshuffle each selection before producing a tailored trip summary.

## Features

-   **Console Application:**  Simple terminal interface for fast setup and use.
    
-   **Random Generator:**  Offers random suggestions in each itinerary category.
    
-   **A La Carte Selections:**  User can accept, reject, or reshuffle options for total customization.
    
-   **Custom Output:**  Each trip is uniquely personalized to user preferences.
    

## Technologies Used

-   Python 3
    

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    bash
    
    `git clone https://github.com/thompsonmikej/Day_Trip_Generator.git cd Day_Trip_Generator` 
    
2.  **Run the app:**
    
    bash
    
    `python day_trip_generator.py` 
    

## Usage

-   Follow the on-screen prompts in your terminal.
    
-   For each trip category (destination, transport, meal, activity, etc.), youâ€™ll receive a random suggestion.
    
-   Choose to accept or reshuffle each option.
    
-   After completing each category, receive a summary of your personalized day trip.
    

## Challenges & Lessons Learned

-   This project was my first experience using Python lists to store dynamic choices and randomize user-facing options.
    
-   I gained practical knowledge in building flexible, menu-driven user flows and managing user input for custom outputs.
    

## Future Improvements

-   Enable users to add their own entries to each category for even more personalized results.
    
-   Expand categories and improve input validation for a smoother experience.
    
-   Consider a simple GUI or web-based front-end for broader accessibility.
